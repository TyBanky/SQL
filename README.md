# Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) Subway Schedule Delay Analysis

The TTC is on the news from time to time. Commuters have labelled TTC services as broken and unreliable amongst other things.

So, I was curious to find out:
* Is TTC subway service as poor as commuters say?
* Are some TTC subway lines more problematic than others?
* Are delays/issues on TTC subways more pronounced during rush hour?
* Do schedule delay patterns differ between weekdays and weekends?
* Are the prominent delay-causing issues within or out of TTC control?


The data used for this project was sourced from [Toronto Open Data Catalogue](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/).

The SQL code in this repository was used to clean/prepare the data in readiness to answer the questions above via a Tableau dashboard
which is hosted [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/TTCSubwayScheduleDelayAnalysis/TTCSubwayScheduleDelayAnalysis?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
